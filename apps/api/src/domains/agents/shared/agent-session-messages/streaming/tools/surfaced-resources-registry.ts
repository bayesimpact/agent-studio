 * as the retrieved-chunks registry (c1, c2...): real ids and links are
 * un-copyable by small models (a mangled character silently breaks the
 * card), and exposing them in the prompt lets a weak model RECITE the
 * referential into the user-visible text instead of calling the tool —
 * observed in production: raw internal link pasted in a chat answer, which
 * the front then rendered. With aliases, a recitation leaks nothing
 * renderable; the surfaceResources tool resolves aliases server-side.
 *
 * Unlike chunks, resources are static for the whole request (they come from
 * the agent's libraries, not from a mid-turn retrieval): the registry is
 * fully populated at build time, and the SAME enumeration order feeds the
 * master prompt listing — aliases in the prompt and in the registry always
 * match because both derive from enumerateAgentResources.
