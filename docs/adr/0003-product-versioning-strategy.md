# ADR 0003: Product Versioning and Release Notes Strategy

* **Status**: Accepted
* **Date**: 2026-02-25 (updated 2026-03-27)
* **Deciders**: Jérémie

---

## 1. Context and Problem Statement

As we move toward our initial product launch, we need a versioning scheme that balances two competing needs:

1. **Technical Granularity**: Internal developers need to manage dependencies and understand breaking changes between libraries.
2. **Market Clarity**: Customers and stakeholders need to easily identify how current their version of the product is without decoding semantic integers.

SemVer is the industry standard for libraries but lacks chronological context. CalVer provides immediate context around the release date, which is more intuitive for a full product/SaaS offering.

## 2. Decision

We will implement a **Dual-Track Versioning System** with a **manual changelog** following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) convention:

### Product Level (CalVer)

The user-facing product (UI and API distribution) will follow the **YY.MM.Micro** format.

* **YY**: Two-digit year (e.g., `26`).
* **MM**: Two-digit month (e.g., `03`).
* **Micro**: Incremental patch integer for hotfixes (e.g., `.0`, `.1`).
* **First Release**: `26.03.0`.

### Internal / Library Level (SemVer)

All internal packages and shared modules will use **SemVer** (`Major.Minor.Patch`).

* Breaking changes are explicitly signaled to the engineering team via a major version bump.

### Release Notes

We follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format in `CHANGELOG.md`:

* Developers update the `[Unreleased]` section as part of their PRs.
* Standard categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.
* Features behind a feature flag are prefixed with `(beta)` and listed last in their category.
* On release, a maintainer pushes a CalVer git tag (e.g., `git tag v26.03.0 && git push --tags`).
* A GitHub Actions workflow (`release.yml`) promotes `[Unreleased]` to a versioned entry, commits the updated changelog, and creates a GitHub Release.

### Traceability

Every CalVer release will embed the **Git Commit SHA** in its metadata for a full audit trail.

> *Example: `26.03.0+sha.a1b2c3d`*

## 3. Alternatives Considered

* **SemVer only**: Rejected because a `v2.0.0` label provides no intuitive signal to customers about when it was released or how outdated their installation is.
* **CalVer only (across all packages)**: Rejected because internal libraries require explicit breaking-change signals that CalVer does not provide by convention.
* **Automated changelogs (release-please, changesets)**: Rejected in favor of a simpler, manual Keep a Changelog approach with no tooling dependency. Developers have full control over wording and categorization.

## 4. Consequences

* **Positive Impacts**:
    * **Predictability**: Marketing and Product teams can plan around named calendar releases (e.g., "March Release").
    * **Transparency**: Customers can immediately identify outdated installations (e.g., seeing `25.12` in 2026).
    * **Reduced friction**: Avoids the psychological hurdle of major version bumps by letting the calendar drive the primary version number.
* **Negative Impacts / Risks**:
    * **Compatibility ambiguity**: CalVer does not inherently signal breaking changes. All breaking changes must be clearly documented in release notes.
    * **Tooling overhead**: CI/CD pipelines must handle two tagging styles (date-based for the product, SemVer for internal artifacts).

## 5. Implementation Notes

* CI/CD: A `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow triggers on CalVer tag pushes (e.g., `v26.03.0`). It extracts the `[Unreleased]` section from `CHANGELOG.md`, promotes it to a versioned entry, commits the update to `main`, and creates a GitHub Release. See `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
* The project `README.md` must be updated to document this versioning standard once accepted.
